###Done
* General setup
* Mesh loading (OBJ with vertices, normals, texture coordinates, faces)
* Texture loading (PNG, 1-3-4 channels, supports wrapping and clamping)
* Line drawing (using Bresenhamâ€™s line drawing algorithm)
* Wireframe drawing for triangular faces
* Triangles rasterization
* Z-buffer
* View and world matrices
* Back faces culling
* Projection matrix
* Primitives clipping
* Shaders (vertex, fragment)
* Multi pass (for AO (SSAO or pre-computation), shadow maps, deferred shading)
* Off-line demo
* Real-time demo

###To do
* Test on Linux, handle both builds in the master branch.
* Optimizations...
